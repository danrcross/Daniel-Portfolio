                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a novice web developer. I am currently enrolled in an online web development bootcamp through the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am motivated by the satisfaction that this work brings: both as an individual, and in the role I could play in a community. Creating something useful for others gives me joy. 
                <br/>
                <br/>                    
                    In my experience so far, coding involves a great deal of logical problem-solving tasks. I have always loved these kinds of puzzles. I am confident that I will be able to work through any challenge that I might meet in my coding career. Already, it has been a pleasure to get some webpages up and running, regardless of their simplicity.

                    <p>This is my first project. A simple site, intended as a study guide for a student who needs to brush up on the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.</p>

                    <p>This site was not created by me. The source code was given to me, and I cleaned up the HTML and CSS. Comments are given in the code.</p>

                    <p>This is a cheat sheet with CSS code snippets. This site uses color gradient properties, transition properties, and the :hover pseudo-class. </p>
