                <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am a novice web developer. I am currently enrolled in an online web development bootcamp through the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am motivated by the satisfaction that this work brings: both as an individual, and in the role I could play in a community. Creating something useful for others gives me joy. 
                    <br/>

                    In my experience so far, coding involves a great deal of logical problem-solving tasks. I have always loved these kinds of puzzles. I am confident that I will be able to work through any challenge that I might meet in my coding career. Already, it has been a pleasure to get some webpages up and running, regardless of their simplicity. 
                    </p>
