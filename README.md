# Daniel Cross's Portfolio

## Description

This site was developed as a basic portfolio webpage for myself. This site will tell a potential employer about me, show a profile image of me, showcase my web development work, and give my contact info.

This site features responsive design: it will adapt to any screen size.

I also used pseudoelements and pseudoclasses in this project. This allows some basic interactivity with the design of the webpage. 

Through this project, I learned and applied the following advanced CSS topics:
- Pseudoelements and pseudoclasses
- Flexbox design
- Viewport units
- Media queries
- Specificity of selectors

## Usage

This website has a couple of notable features. This site uses responsive design, and will adapt to smaller screens and mobile devices. Also: when viewing the "Applications" section, the border a site image will become red when the pointer hovers over an image. See this represented in the following screenshots:
